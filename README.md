# Sorting Comparison Project

This Java project includes a set of classes and tests designed to compare different sorting algorithms. The project also features a `Person` class and tests for sorting `Person` objects.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of various sorting algorithms. It includes a `Person` class for testing sorting functionality, along with associated test cases to ensure correctness.

## Features
- Implementation of different sorting algorithms.
- Comparison of sorting algorithms' performance.
- `Person` class for sorting based on attributes.
- Test cases for validating sorting functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-comparison.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   Copy code
   cd sorting-comparison
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   Copy code
   javac *.java
4. Run the main application or tests:
   ```sh
   Copy code
   java SortingComparison
   java PersonSorterTest

### Usage
-  Running Sorting Comparison
- Execute the SortingComparison class to see the performance comparison of different sorting algorithms.
- Testing Sorting Functionality
- Execute the PersonSorterTest class to run the test cases for sorting Person objects.
