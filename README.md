# Sorting Comparison Project

This Java project includes a set of classes and tests designed to compare different sorting algorithms. The project also features a `Person` class and tests for sorting `Person` objects.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of various sorting algorithms. It includes a `Person` class for testing sorting functionality, along with associated test cases to ensure correctness.

## Features
- Implementation of different sorting algorithms.
- Comparison of sorting algorithms' performance.
- `Person` class for sorting based on attributes.
- Test cases for validating sorting functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-comparison.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```sh
  cd sorting-comparison
  Compile the Java files:
  ```sh
  javac *.java
  Run the main application or tests:
  ```sh
  java SortingComparison
  java PersonSorterTest

### Usage
  Execute the SortingComparison class to see the performance comparison of different sorting algorithms.
  Testing Sorting Functionality
  Execute the PersonSorterTest class to run the test cases for sorting Person objects.
  Person: Class representing a person with attributes used for sorting.
  Person Sorter Test: Test class for sorting Person objects.
  PersonSorterTest: Additional test class for sorting Person objects.
  SortingComparison.java: Main class for comparing different sorting algorithms.
